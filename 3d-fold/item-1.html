		<h2>BS CS-CSE</h2>
		<em>Learn how analog electronics combined with software can change the lives of people!</em>
		<p>
			The Computer System Engineering (CSE) program combines a computer science curriculum with selected subjects in computer engineering, combining synergistically the power of digital computers with analog electronics, electromechanical systems and computer software. Curriculum tracks specializing in embedded systems, mobile robotics, digital signal processing, and system automation are offered. With these, students in this program gain the knowledge of developing application-specific computer-based systems, with emphasis on real-time systems and automation. Computer System Engineering graduates can pursue careers as microprocessor systems designers, embedded system engineers, test engineers, and system software developers. Possessing excellent hard and soft skills, CSE graduates are ready to be productive individuals in the IT and allied industries.
