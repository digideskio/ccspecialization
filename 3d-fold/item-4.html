			The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science major in Software Technology (BSCS) program prepares students to become holistic and competent computer scientists and IT professionalswho are capable of designing effective and efficient technological solutions for nation building. With a good understanding of the foundation theories of Computer Science, the program provides opportunities for students to discover and strategically manage innovative technology to help shape the future of computing. With various research programs and activities to keep pace with the rapid advancement in technology, ST students are engaged in advanced research and product development in various fields. Armed with a good grasp of core computer science concepts and abreast with current advances in technology, ST graduates not only produce software solutions that are relevant to the needs of the community, but also exemplify leadership qualities in order to set and pursue future directions for the computing industry and research.
			The program also provides the necessary background for students to pursue graduate studies to further their knowledge and skills in conducting advanced research in computing and technology. Through the ladderized Master of Science in Computer Science program, qualified ST students can earn two degrees (BSCS and MSCS) in a span of five years, thereby reinforcing the university’s and college’s mission of producing more graduates who are highly competent and qualified to work in this globally-competitive environment.
